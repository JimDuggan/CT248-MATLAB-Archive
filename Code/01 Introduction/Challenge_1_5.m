% set the number of throws as a constant N

% set the random seed to 100 to ensure replication, using rng()

% create the random throws of 2 dice, using randi([L U],r,c)
% L - lower value U - upper value r = # rows c = # cols

% sum the two dice (each row) and store in a variable. Use the 
% MATLAB function sum()

% find all the occurances of the value 7, and display proportion
% try for 10,100,1000,10000,100000 and 1000000 rolls

% write a loop to calculate the proportion of all outcomes and 
% store in a vector
